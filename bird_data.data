        BIRD FACT
        
            
                There are over 9,500 species of birds in the world. Scientists typically group tem into 30
                    categories. Birds are the most widespread of all animals around the world.
                
                The Sword-billed Hummingbird is the only bird with a bill longer than its bod.
                Approximately 23 of all the bird species are found in tropical rain forests
                The longest feathers ever seen were on a chicken in Japan. Its tail feathers measured 34.7 feet
                    (10.59 m) long.
                
                Hoatzin chicks have two claws on each wing. When they climb out of the nest, they use their claws to
                    hold on to mangrove trees. They lose their claws once they mature, but they remain poor flyers.
                
                To make them more lightweight, most birds do not have bladders to store urine. Rather than producing
                    liquid urine to get rid of wastes, they produce a white, pasty substance. However, while an ostrich
                    does not have a bladder like a mammalian bladder, it is unique among birds because it does have a
                    complete separation of feces and urine.
                
                A bird’s lungs are much more complicated and efficient and take up more space than those of mammals,
                    such as humans. A human’s lungs compose about 120 of its body, but a bird’s takes up 15.
                
                The Australian pelican has the longest bill of any bird in the world. It is nearly 2 feet (0.5 m) in
                    length. The sword-billed hummingbird, with its 3.9-inch (10 cm) bill, is the only bird with a bill
                    that’s longer than its body.
                
                Owls cannot swivel their eyes. Instead they move their heads completely around to see straight
                    behind them. They live on every continent except Antarctica. Soft fringes on their wings make their
                    flight essentially silent.
                
                Famous birds include Ba in Egyptian mythology, Bar Juchne in the Talmud, The Cu Bird in Mexican
                    folklore, the Firebird in Native American mythologies, Harpies in Greek mythology, the Phoenix in
                    Egyptian mythology, Quetzalcoatl in Aztec mythology, and the Raven in Native American religions.
                
                Famous birds in literature include the Albatross in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Archimedes in
                    The Once and Future King, Chicken Little, Chanticleer in Chaucer’s Nun’s Priest’s Tale, Fawkes and
                    Hedwig in Harry Potter, Mother Goose, the Ravenin Edgar Allen Poe’s “The Raven,” Owl in Winnie the
                    Pooh, Thorondor (the king of eagles) in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, and The Ugly Duckling.
                
                Famous birds in cartoons, comics, and films include Big Bird in Sesame Street, Buzz Buzzard in Woody
                    Woodpecker, Disney’s Darkwing Duck, Footloops cereal’s Toucan Sam, Woodstock in the Peanuts comic
                    strip, Woody Woodpecker, and Iago in Aladdin.
                
                In the continental U.S. alone, between 1.4 billion and 3.7 billion birds are killed by cats
                    annually.
                
                The only bird with nostrils at the end of its beak is the kiwi. This placement helps it sniff for
                    food, such as worms and insects on the ground. It often sorts to clear its nostrils.
                
                Unlike most birds that sing, a woodpecker will drum its beak against a tree. Other woodpeckers can
                    identify which bird it is by the sound of the drumming.
                
                The most talkative bird in the world is the African gray parrot. One parrot could say over 800 words.
                    Most species of parrots can learn only 50.
                
                Many birds, such as starlings, sing notes too high for humans to hear.
                The chicks of large bird species often take the longest to hatch. Emu chicks, for example, take 60
                    days to hatch. Small songbirds take just 2 weeks.
                
                A green woodpecker can eat as many as 2,000 ants per day.
                The Japanese crested ibis is one of the rarest birds in the world. Probably fewer than 50 crested
                    ibises are alive today.
                
                The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska polluted approximately 1,180 miles of coastline and killed
                    up to 100,000 seabirds.
                
                The bird with the most feathers is the whistling swan, with up to 25,000 feathers. Hummingbirds, on
                    the other hand, are so small that they have fewer than 1,000.
                
                Falconry was developed more than 4,000 years ago in eastern and central Asia. Birds were used
                    because they could kill animals beyond the range of a hunter’s weapon. Genghis Khan reportedly had
                    10,000 falconers.
                
                Coalminers often used canaries to detect poisonous levels of carbon monoxide gas. Miners knew that
                    if the canary passed out, they were in danger, too. The phrase “Canary in a Coalmine” derives from
                    this history.
                
                The marsh warbler can mimic more than 80 different birds. Other renowned mimics include mockingbirds
                    and lyrebirds.
                
                A pelican’s pouch-like beak can hold up to 2.5 gallons of water at a time. The beak will shrink to
                    squeeze out the water before the pelican swallows its food.
                
                A vulture named the Lammergeyer will fly with bones high in the air and then drop them onto rocks.
                    It will then eat the smashed bones, ike a circus sword swallower.
                
                The bird that lays the smallest egg in the world is the bee hummingbird. Its egg is just under 0.5
                    x 0.25 and weighs a mere 0.02 oz.
                
                Though it looks like a bird’s knee is bending backwards, what is bending backward is actually its
                    ankle. Below its ankle is an extended foot bone, leading to the toes. A bird’s real knee is usually
                    hidden by feathers.
                
                The ostrich lays the biggest egg in the world. It measures 7 x 5 and weighs 3 pounds. However, the
                    biggest egg for the size of the mother i laid by the kiwi and is a third of the weight of the bird.
                    It is 5 long and can weigh as much as 1 lb. This would be the equivalent of an ostrich laying an 88
                    lb. (40 kg.) egg.
                
                The Malleefowl is famed for making a huge compost pile for its nest. Its eggs are incubated by the
                    heat given off by the rotting vegetation.
                
                Social weaverbirds live in huge communal nests that look like a huge haystack spread across a
                    treetop. Some nests can weigh a few tons, have over 400 birds living in them, and may be 100 years
                    old.
                
                The heaviest bird of prey is the Andean condor. It can weigh up to 27 lb. (12 kg.).
                The most common wild bird in the world is the red-billed Quelea, with an estimated adult breeding
                    population of1.5 billion pairs. It mostly lives in sub-Saharan Africa and thousands of birds can be
                    in a single flock. The most common non-wild bird is the chicken.
                
                Many scientists believe that birds evolved from dinosaurs during the Mesozoic Er about 150 million
                    years ago.
                
                Flamingos pair for a lifetime. Some stay with their mates for 50 ears or more.
                In the United States alone, there are over 40 million pet birds.
                A bird’s feathers weigh more than its skeleton.
                The type of diet a bird eats in the wild is directly related to the shape of a bird’s beak.
                While most male birds do not have a penis, the Argentine Lake Duck’s penis can extend 17, the
                    longest of any bird known. The duck itself is only about 16 inches tall. The base of the penis i
                    covered with coarse spines, and the tip is soft and brush-like, perhaps to clean sperm that may have
                    been deposited in the female’s oviduct by another suitor. When not in use, the corkscrew shaped
                    penis retracts into the duck’s abdomen.
                
                Approximately 75% of wild birds live for less than a year. The larger the bird, the more likely it
                    is to live longer. The large wandering albatrass, for example, can live for up to 80 years.
                
                Gentoo Penguins are the fastest swimming birds, reaching speeds of 22 mph (36 kph). Emperor Penguins
                    can stay under water for up to 18 minutes.
                
                Arctic terns have the longest annual migration of any bird. They fly 25,000 miles (40,000 m) from
                    the Arcticto the Antarctic and then back again.
                
                The bird with the greatest wingspan of any other bird is the Wandering Albatross at up to 11.8 ft
                    (3.63 m).
                
                Bar-headed Geese fly across the Himalayas, the highest mountains in the world. They fly nearly 5
                    miles (over 8,000 m) up in the sky, almost as high as jet planes. The highest-flying bird is the
                    Griffon Vulture. In 1973, one collided with an airplane more than 6.8 miles above the Ivory Coast in
                    Africa.
                
                The largest, tallest, and heaviest bird in the world is the ostrich. Male ostriches can reach up to
                    9 ft. tall (2.7 m) ad weigh up to 350 lb. (160 kg). Their eyes are bigger than any other land
                    animals' eyes and are even larger than their brain.
                
                The song of a European wren is made of more than 700 different notes a minute ad can be heard 1,650
                    feet (500 m) away.
                
                The ostrich is the only bird that willingly takes care of other females’ eggs.
                Ostriches do not bury their heads in the sand when danger is near. But they have been seen to lie on
                    the ground with their long neck stretched out flat if they want to hide.
                
                The biggest bird that ever existed on Earth is the flightless elephant bird, which is now extinct.
                    It weighed about 1000 lb. (450 kg.). Seven ostrich eggs would fit inside one elephant bird’s egg.
                    Elephant birds died out 400 years ago,but people still find pieces of their tough-shelled eggs.
                
                The Emperor Penguin is the only bird that lays its eggs in the middle of winter. By laying its eggs
                    so early, it gives its young a head start. The babies need all spring, summer, and fall to grow big
                    enough to survive the next winter.
                
                Oilbirds eat oil palm fruits, which make the birds oily too. People near the caves where the
                    oilbirds lived used to trap the oilbirds and boil them down for the oil.
                
                The fastest flying bird in a dive is the Peregrine Falcon. It averages speeds of over 110 mph (180
                    kph).
                
                Oilbirds are the only birds that use echolocation the way that bats do. However, bats are much
                    better at it. A bat can even fly through the blades of a moving fan. Oilbirds are also the only
                    nocturnal fruit-eating birds in the world.
                
                Birds have three fingers on each wing. The first, the thumb, supports a small part of the wing
                    called the alula (a.k.a bastard wing). The second and third fingers support the main flight
                    feathers.
                
                Birds typically have two, three, or four toes. A typical perching bird has three pointing forward,
                    and one back. Birds that run on hard ground have only three, all pointing forward. Ostriches only
                    have two toes, which are shaped like the hoof of an antelope.
                
                The Sooty Tern spends more time in the air than any other bird. It takes off over the ocean and
                    flies for at least 3 years without settling on water or land. Swifts also spend most of their lives
                    in the air. They can even sleep in the air by gliding on air currents with their wings
                    outstretched.
                
                Birds don’t fall off of a branch when they sleep because their toes automatically clench around the
                    twig they are standing on. Because the grabbing action is done by tendons rather than muscles, th
                    birds can sleep without danger of falling.
                
                The wishbone (or “merry thought” bone) is a bird’s fused collarbone. The strongest fliers have the
                    widest angles in their wishbones. They are the only vertebrate animals to have a fused collarbone.
                
                Not all birds have equally hollow bones. Those that dive into water—like gannets, terns, and
                    kingfishers—and those that fly very fast, like swifts, have less air in their long bones than other
                    birds.
                
                The linear flight formations of migratory birds ae called echelons, with the most common shapes
                    being the “V” or the “J.” In fact, a true V-shaped formation is less common than a J formation.
                    Birds fly in formation a) because it saves energy and b) to facilitate orientation and communication
                    among the birds.
                
                The word parakeet literally means long tail.
                An albatross can soar for as long as six hours without moving its wings.
                The heaviest bird in the air is the Kori Bustard, from East and South Africa. It weighs about 31 lb.
                    (14 kg.), with the largest on recorded being 40 lb. (18 kg.). Because it is such hard work to fly,
                    it
                    flies only in emergencies and for only short distances.
                
                A Ruby-throated Hummingbird, which weighs less than 0.2 oz., has to beat its wings more than 52
                    times a second to hover in front of a flower.
                
                What keeps a bird up in the air is the shape of its wings. The first humans to discover how birds
                    stay aloft were Australian Aborigines when they invented the boomerang.
                
                The fastest level flight by a bird has been seen in both the Spine-tailed Swift and the Red-breasted
                    Merganser (a duck). They have flown at 100 mph (161 kph) in level flight.
                
                The slowest flying bird is the American Woodcock. It can fly at just 5 mph (8 kph). When
                    hummingbirds hover, they move at 0 mph. Additionally, hummingbirds are the only bids that can fly
                    backwards under power, registering a negative speed.
                
                The Rufous hummingbird is the smallest migrant bird. It is less than 4 in. (9 cm) long and flies
                    every year from Alaska to Mexico, a round trip f 3,800 miles (6,400 km).
                
                Lighthouses are dangerous for birds. The beams attract birds, especially in misty conditions, and
                    many are killed when they fly into the glass.
                
                Birds sense winter is coming by 1) changes in hormones that cause them to put on fat, 2) the
                    changing length of the day, and 3) sensing small changes in air pressure, which is important in
                    predicting weather changes.
                
                Crows can recognize and remember human faces, particularly faces they associate with bad
                    experiences. They can even share their grudge against a specific person with other crows.
                
                A group of crows is called a murder or congress. A group of owls is called a parliament, wisdom, or
                    study. A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance.
                
                The Bald Eagle builds the largest tree nest of all birds, measuring about 9.5 ft. (2.9 m) across.
                    The largest nest ever found was nearly 10 ft. wide and weighed close to 3 tons.
                
                Woodcocks and many ducks have their eyes placed at the sides of their heads so that they have a
                    360-degree field of vision.
                
                A special arrangement of blood vessels cools the blood going out to the feet and warms the blood
                    coming back, so even hen standing on the ice, birds don’t lose too much heat.
                
                Both the Bee and the Vervain Hummingbirds build the smallest nests of all birds, measuring 34
                    across and 1.2 deep.
                
                The most dangerous bird in the world is the Cassowary. With one kick it can kill its enemy.
                Birds that are raised for meat and eggs (poultry) are the largest source of protein eaten by
                    humans.
                
                To attract a mate, a male Frigate bird will blow up its red throat pouch. The pouch can be as big as
                    a person’s head.
                
                Over time, a surprising number of birds have lost their ability to fly. Being flightless has several
                    advantages. For example, a flightless bird doesn’t need to develop and carry large flight muscles or
                    burn up the energy that flying requires. A flightless bird can also get by with less food, which
                    means it can survive in places where food is scarce.
                
                Depending on the species, a woodpecker’s tongue can be up to 4 long. It stores this long tongue by
                    curling it in and sticking it through a specialized opening at the back of its neck, where it can
                    then put it between the skull and skin.
                
                The seagulls in the Alfred Hitchcock movie The Birds (1963) were fed a mixture of wheat and whisky
                    so they would stand around and not fly too much.
                
                The Fieldfare birds have a special way to attack an enemy bird. They gang up on it and make it fly
                    to the ground. Then the Fieldfares fly into the air and drop poop on the bird.
                
                In the movie The Birds (1963), the scene where actress Tippi Hedren is attacked took a week to
                    shoot. The birds were attached to her clothes by long nylon threads so they could not fly away.
                
                Birds play a central role in many creation myths. Birds are also often associated with the journey
                    of the soul after death or as mediators between the dead and living. They can also appear as oracles
                    or tricksters.
                
                The game Angry Birds has sold more than 7 million copies on Apple’s iPhone. The game was made by a
                    team of just four people. It was such a low priority for the company that it took over 8 months to
                    finish.
                
                Wind farms kill approximately a half-million birds per year in the United States, according to a
                    2008 Fish and Wildlife study. Nearly 10,000 birds, almost all of which are protected by the
                    migratory bird acts, are killed every year at the wind farm in Altamont Pass, C, alone.
                
                Approximately 200 people have died since 1988 because of airborne collision between airplanes and
                    birds. Brd strikes cause $300 million of damage each year to aircraft. The first recorded bird
                    strike was in 1905, when Orville Wright’s plane hit a bird and killed it.
                
                In the novel To Kill a Mockingbird (1960), author Harper Lee used the mockingbird to symbolize
                    innocence.
                
                The smallest flightless bird is the Island Rail. This tiny bird lives on the remote island of
                    Tristan da Cunha in the Atlantic Ocean and is just 5 long, about the same size as a hen chick.
                
                The earliest known bird is the Archaeopteryx. It lived during the Jurassic period 150 million ears
                    ago. Because it did not have the basic features of flight, scientists are uncertain if it could
                    fly.
                
                Vultures have stomach acid so corrosive that they can digest carcasses infected with anthrax.
                No other living being other than birds have feathers. The main function is to help them fly. They
                    also waterproof birds ad protect them from UV rays and other harmful elements.
                
                Only one mammal can fly the bat However, it flies differently from the bird. Insects also do not
                    fly the same as birds.
                
                A Bald Eagle is called “bald” because it is piebald (black and white), not because it doesn’t have
                    any feathers.
                
                Eleven percent of the world’s bird species is endangered. Draining wetlands and felling forests are
                    the main causes of damage, but pollution and pesticides also play a part.
                
                Before 1840, there were thousands of millions of passenger pigeons in North America. However, they
                    were slaughtered for food until only one was left, a female called Martha. She died when she was 12
                    years old in 1914, in a zoo in Ohio.
                
                More than 150 kinds of birds have become extinct since 1600, though many more may have died out that
                    scientists don’t know about. It wasn’t just European explorers that killed bird species. Archeology
                    shows that when people first arrived in ancient times in Hawaii and on islands in the South Pacific
                    and Caribbean, they killed many birds Europeans had never seen before.
                
                The word swan is derived from the Indo-European root swen, meaning to sound, to sing.
                Someone who suffers from anatidaephobia believes that somewhere, somehow a duck or goose is
                    constantly watching them. The word anatidaephobia is from Greek word anatidae, which means ducks,
                    geese or other water fowls, and phobos is Greek for fear.
                
                There are more fake flamingos on Earth than real ones.
                Though the term “eagle eyed” implies that eagles have keen vision, only the Wedge-tailed Eagle can
                    see better than humans (2½ times better). Kestrels and falcons have about the same power of sight as
                    we do.
                

                The chicken is the closest living relative to the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
                Many birds kept as pets, including doves, parakeets, and lovebirds, enjoy living in pairs for
                    companionship.
                
                The smallest bird egg belongs to the hummingbird and is the size of a pea. The largest bird egg,
                    from which the ostrich hatches, is the size of a cantaloupe.
                
                A bird’s eye takes up about 50 percent of its head; our eyes take up about 5 percent of our head. To
                    be comparable to a bird’s eyes, our eyes would have to be the size of baseballs.
                
                The penguin is the only bird that can swim, but not fly. It is also the only bird that walks
                    upright.
                
                Owls turn their heads almost 360○ (a complete circle) but they cannot move their eyes.
                Chickens have over 200 distinct noises they make for communicating.
                When it comes to birds, the males tend to have the more glamorous feather shape, coloration, songs,
                    and dances. Female birds choose their mate based on how attractive they find them!
                
                It is estimated that one third of all bird owners turn on a radio for their pet when they leave the
                    house.
                
                According to National Geographic, scientists have an answer for the age old dispute over which came
                    first, the chicken or the egg. Reptiles were laying eggs thousands of years before chickens
                    appeared. The first chicken came from an egg laid by a bird that was not quite a chicken. Therefore,
                    the egg came first.
                
                The first bird domesticated by humans was the goose.
                Kiwi birds are blind, so they hunt by smell.
                Some breeds of chickens can lay colored eggs. The Ameraucana and Araucana can lay green or blue
                    eggs.
                
                The common phrase “eat like a bird” should mean something quite different! Many birds eat twice
                    their weight in food each day. In fact, a bird requires more food in proportion to its size than a
                    baby or a cat.
                
                A group of larks is called an exaltation, a group of chickens is called a peep, a group of geese is
                    called a gaggle, a group of ravens is called a murder, and a group of owls is called a parliament.
                
                Chickens that lay brown eggs have red ear lobes. There is a genetic link between the two.
                Crows have the largest cerebral hemispheres (brains), relative to body size, of any avian family.
                
                Mockingbirds can imitate many sounds, from a squeaking door to a cat meowing.

        FOOD Northern Cardinal
        Feeds on many insects, including beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, caterpillars, ants, flies, and many others, also spiders, centipedes, and snails. Most of diet is vegetable matter, including seeds of weeds and grasses, waste grain, leaf buds, flowers, and many berries and wild fruits. Young are fed mostly insects.
    
    
        FOOD Northern Mockingbird
        Northern Mockingbirds eat mainly insects in summer but switch to eating mostly fruit in fall and winter. Among their animal prey are beetles, earthworms, moths, butterflies, ants, bees, wasps, grasshoppers, and sometimes small lizards. They eat a wide variety of berries, including from ornamental bushes, as well as fruits from multiflora rose. They’ve been seen drinking sap from the cuts on recently pruned trees.
    
    
        FOOD Mourning Dove
        Unlike other songbirds of summer, Mourning Doves don’t have an appetite for insects, spiders and creepy crawlies. They’re almost 100% granivores, going for the grains, seeds from wild grasses, weeds and herbs. They’ll also grab the occasional berry or snail.
    
    
        FOOD White winged Dove
        Across much of its range, the vegetarian White-winged Dove eats mostly grains and other agricultural crops like wheat, sunflower, milo, corn, and safflower. It also eats fruits and large seeds from plants like spurge, panic grass, bristlegrass, Mexican jumping beans, Chinese tallow, leatherweed, saguaro, lime prickly-ash, brasil, privet, pigeonberry, and ocotillo. The White-winged Dove seems to be predisposed toward large seeds because of its large bill and gape, along with its slower eating style (it never pecks quickly, the way Mourning Doves do).
    
    
        FOOD Great tailed Grackle
        Diet is extremely varied; includes many insects, also spiders, millipedes, snails, crayfish, tadpoles, small fish, lizards, eggs and nestlings of other birds, and sometimes adult birds. Also eats a wide variety of seeds, waste grain, berries, fruit, and nuts.
    
    
        FOOD Yellow rumped Warbler
        Insects and berries. Feeds on caterpillars, wasps, grasshoppers, gnats, aphids, beetles, and many other insects; also spiders. Feeds in winter on berries of bayberry, juniper, wax myrtle, poison ivy, and others. Can winter farther north than most warblers because it can digest the wax in berry coatings.
    
    
        FOOD House Sparrow
        They are frequent visitors to backyard feeders, where they eat most kinds of birdseed, especially millet, corn, and sunflower seed.
    
    
        FOOD Ruby crowned Kinglet
        Mostly insects. At all seasons, diet is primarily small insects, the birds concentrating on whatever is most readily available; includes many small beetles, flies, leafhoppers, true bugs, caterpillars, and many others. Also eats spiders and pseudoscorpions; diet includes eggs of insects and spiders. In winter, also eats some berries and seeds. Sometimes takes oozing sap or visits flowers, possibly for nectar.
    
    
        FOOD Eastern Phoebe

It is acrobatic while feeding chickadees hang upside down and tilt their head and body up to reach insects on leaves and tree bark. In winter, they live in small flocks of 2 to 8 chickadees to create a feeding territory, which they will defend from other flocks.
    
    
        FOOD House Finch
        Feeds mainly on weed seeds. Other important items include buds and flower parts in spring, berries and small fruits in late summer and fall. Also eats a few insects, mostly small ones such as aphids. Young are fed on regurgitated seeds.
    
    
        FOOD American Goldfinch

        ABOUT Northern Cardinal
        the Cardinal is the official state bird of no fewer than seven eastern states. Abundant in the Southeast, it has been extending its range northward for decades, and it now brightens winter days with its color and its whistled song as far north as southeastern Canada.
    
    
        ABOUT Northern Mockingbird
        
            
                The mockingbird's latin name is Mimus polyglottos, which literally translates to “many-tongued mimic.” A polyglot is a person who speaks many languages, referencing the bird’s ability to imitate sounds from its environment. While mockingbirds are known to sing several hundred different songs, some research suggests that they might not learn to copy new sounds in adulthood, as previously thought.
                The white patches on a Northern Mockingbird’s wings and outer tail feathers serve dual purposes The birds often show off these plumes during mating rituals, and they also flash them when defending their territory from potential predators like hawks and snakes. 
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT Mourning Dove
        
            
                Mourning Doves eat roughly 12 to 20 percent of their body weight per day, or 71 calories on average.
                A graceful, slender-tailed, small-headed dove that’s common across the continent. Mourning Doves perch on telephone wires and forage for seeds on the ground; their flight is fast and bullet straight. Their soft, drawn-out calls sound like laments. When taking off, their wings make a sharp whistling or whinnying. Mourning Doves are the most frequently hunted species in North America.
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT White winged Dove
        
            
                Originally a bird of desert thickets, the White-winged Dove has become a common sight in cities and towns across the southern U.S. When perched, this bird’s unspotted brown upperparts and neat white crescents along the wing distinguish it from the ubiquitous Mourning Dove. In flight, those subdued crescents become flashing white stripes worthy of the bird’s common name. Take a closer look and you’ll see a remarkably colorful face, with bright-orange eyes and blue “eye shadow.”
                Like other doves and pigeons, White-winged Doves have some unusual abilities. They can suck and swallow water without moving their heads. And they use a secretion from the esophagus, known as crop milk, to feed nestlings. Both parents may consume snails and bone fragments to help their bodies create the nutritious fluid.
                Although the White-winged Dove is mostly resident in the Southwest, it is expanding its range, and individuals can be found far afield. White-winged Doves have been seen from Alaska to Ontario, Maine, Newfoundland, and most places in between. 
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT Great tailed Grackle
        
            
                A big, brash blackbird, the male Great-tailed Grackle shimmers in iridescent black and purple, and trails a tail that will make you look twice. The rich brown females are about half the male’s size. Flocks of these long-legged, social birds strut and hop on suburban lawns, golf courses, fields, and marshes in Texas, the Southwest, and southern Great Plains. In the evening, raucous flocks pack neighborhood trees, filling the sky with their amazing (some might say ear-splitting) voices. 
                Because they’re smaller and require less food, female Great-tailed Grackle chicks are more likely than their brothers to survive to fledging. Likewise, adult females may outlive males, resulting in a “sex-biased” population with greater numbers of females than males. 
                Although you’ll usually see them feeding on land, Great-tailed Grackles may also wade into the water to grab a frog or fish. 
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT Yellow rumped Warbler
        
            
                Yellow-rumped Warblers are impressive in the sheer numbers with which they flood the continent each fall. Shrubs and trees fill with the streaky brown-and-yellow birds and their distinctive, sharp chips. Though the color palette is subdued all winter, you owe it to yourself to seek these birds out on their spring migration or on their breeding grounds. Spring molt brings a transformation, leaving them a dazzling mix of bright yellow, charcoal gray and black, and bold white. 
                Male Yellow-rumped Warblers tend to forage higher in trees than females do. 
                When Yellow-rumped Warblers find themselves foraging with other warbler species, they typically let Palm, Magnolia and Black-throated Green warblers do as they wish, but they assert themselves over Pine and Blackburnian warblers.
                The Yellow-rumped Warbler is the only warbler able to digest the waxes found in bayberries and wax myrtles. Its ability to use these fruits allows it to winter farther north than other warblers, sometimes as far north as Newfoundland. 
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT House Sparrow
        
            
                You can find House Sparrows most places where there are houses (or other buildings), and few places where there aren’t. Along with two other introduced species, the European Starling and the Rock Pigeon, these are some of our most common birds. Their constant presence outside our doors makes them easy to overlook, and their tendency to displace native birds from nest boxes causes some people to resent them. But House Sparrows, with their capacity to live so intimately with us, are just beneficiaries of our own success.
                The House Sparrow prefers to nest in manmade structures such as eaves or walls of buildings, street lights, and nest boxes instead of in natural nest sites such as holes in trees.
                The House Sparrow takes frequent dust baths. It throws soil and dust over its body feathers, just as if it were bathing with water. In doing so, a sparrow may make a small depression in the ground, and sometimes defends this spot against other sparrows.
                House Sparrows aggressively defend their nest holes. A scientist in 1889 reported cases of House Sparrows attacking 70 different bird species. House Sparrows sometimes evict other birds from nest holes, including Eastern Bluebirds, Purple Martins, and Tree Swallows.
                House Sparrows have been seen stealing food from American Robins and piercing flowers to drain them of nectar.
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT Ruby crowned Kinglet
        
            
                A tiny bird seemingly overflowing with energy, the Ruby-crowned Kinglet forages almost frantically through lower branches of shrubs and trees. Its habit of constantly flicking its wings is a key identification clue. Smaller than a warbler or chickadee, this plain green-gray bird has a white eyering and a white bar on the wing. Alas, the male’s brilliant ruby crown patch usually stays hidden—your best chance to see it is to find an excited male singing in spring or summer.
                Ruby-crowned Kinglets seem nervous as they flit through the foliage, flicking their wings nearly constantly. Keeping an eye out for this habit can be a useful aid to identifying kinglets.
                Metabolic studies on Ruby-crowned Kinglets suggest that these tiny birds use only about 10 calories (technically, kilocalories) per day.
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT Eastern Phoebe
        
            
                One of our most familiar eastern flycatchers, the Eastern Phoebe’s raspy “phoebe” call is a frequent sound around yards and farms in spring and summer. These brown-and-white songbirds sit upright and wag their tails from prominent, low perches. They typically place their mud-and-grass nests in protected nooks on bridges, barns, and houses, which adds to the species’ familiarity to humans. Hardy birds, Eastern Phoebes winter farther north than most other flycatchers and are one of the earliest returning migrants in spring. 
                The use of buildings and bridges for nest sites has allowed the Eastern Phoebe to tolerate the landscape changes made by humans and even expand its range. However, it still uses natural nest sites when they are available.
                Unlike most birds, Eastern Phoebes often reuse nests in subsequent years—and sometimes Barn Swallows use them in between. In turn, Eastern Phoebes may renovate and use old American Robin or Barn Swallow nests themselves.
                The Eastern Phoebe is a loner, rarely coming in contact with other phoebes. Even members of a mated pair do not spend much time together. They may roost together early in pair formation, but even during egg laying the female frequently chases the male away from her.
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT Barn Swallow
        
            
                Glistening cobalt blue above and tawny below, Barn Swallows dart gracefully over fields, barnyards, and open water in search of flying insect prey. Look for the long, deeply forked tail that streams out behind this agile flyer and sets it apart from all other North American swallows. Barn Swallows often cruise low, flying just a few inches above the ground or water. True to their name, they build their cup-shaped mud nests almost exclusively on human-made structures.
                The Barn Swallow is the most abundant and widely distributed swallow species in the world. It breeds throughout the Northern Hemisphere and winters in much of the Southern Hemisphere.
                Barn Swallow parents sometimes get help from other birds to feed their young. These “helpers at the nest” are usually older siblings from previous clutches, but unrelated juveniles may help as well. 
                According to legend, the Barn Swallow got its forked tail because it stole fire from the gods to bring to people. An angry deity hurled a firebrand at the swallow, singeing away its middle tail feathers.
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT Blue Jay
        
            
                This common, large songbird is familiar to many people, with its perky crest; blue, white, and black plumage; and noisy calls. Blue Jays are known for their intelligence and complex social systems with tight family bonds. Their fondness for acorns is credited with helping spread oak trees after the last glacial period.
                The Blue Jay frequently mimics the calls of hawks, especially the Red-shouldered Hawk. These calls may provide information to other jays that a hawk is around, or may be used to deceive other species into believing a hawk is present.
                Tool use has never been reported for wild Blue Jays, but captive Blue Jays used strips of newspaper to rake in food pellets from outside their cages.
                Blue Jays lower their crests when they are feeding peacefully with family and flock members or tending to nestlings.
                The pigment in Blue Jay feathers is melanin, which is brown. The blue color is caused by scattering light through modified cells on the surface of the feather barbs.
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT Carolina Wren
        
            
                In summer it can seem that every patch of woods in the eastern United States rings with the rolling song of the Carolina Wren. This shy bird can be hard to see, but it delivers an amazing number of decibels for its size. Follow its teakettle-teakettle! and other piercing exclamations through backyard or forest, and you may be rewarded with glimpses of this bird's rich cinnamon plumage, white eyebrow stripe, and long, upward-cocked tail. This hardy bird has been wintering farther and farther north in recent decades.
                Unlike other wren species in its genus, only the male Carolina Wren sings the loud song. In other species, such as the Stripe-breasted Wren of Central America, both members of a pair sing together. The male and female sing different parts, and usually interweave their songs such that they sound like a single bird singing.
                A pair bond may form between a male and a female at any time of the year, and the pair will stay together for life. Members of a pair stay together on their territory year-round, and forage and move around the territory together.
                One captive male Carolina Wren sang nearly 3,000 times in a single day.
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT Carolina Chickadee
        
            
                John James Audubon named this bird while he was in South Carolina. The curious, intelligent Carolina Chickadee looks very much like a Black-capped Chickadee, with a black cap, black bib, gray wings and back, and whitish underside. Carolina and Black-capped chickadees hybridize in the area where their ranges overlap, but the two species probably diverged more than 2.5 million years ago. 
                Where the two species ranges come in contact, the Carolina and Black-capped chickadees occasionally hybridize. Hybrids can sing the songs of either species, or might sing something intermediate. 
                The pair bond between a male and female Carolina Chickadee can remain intact for several years. The probability that a pair will remain together seems to vary among populations, with nearly all pairs remaining together in subsequent years in a study in Texas, but only half staying together in a study in Tennessee. If a nest attempt fails, a female may seek out a new male on a different territory. 
                In winter, Carolina Chickadees live in flocks of two to eight birds and defend areas against other flocks. Dominant birds in these flocks establish breeding territories in the summer that were part of the winter flock's range. 
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT House Finch
        
            
                The House Finch is a recent introduction from western into eastern North America (and Hawaii), but it has received a warmer reception than other arrivals like the European Starling and House Sparrow. That’s partly due to the cheerful red head and breast of males, and to the bird’s long, twittering song, which can now be heard in most of the neighborhoods of the continent. If you haven’t seen one recently, chances are you can find one at the next bird feeder you come across.
                House Finches were introduced to Oahu from San Francisco sometime before 1870. They had become abundant on all the major Hawaiian Islands by 1901.
                House Finches feed their nestlings exclusively plant foods, a fairly rare occurrence in the bird world. Many birds that are vegetarians as adults still find animal foods to keep their fast-growing young supplied with protein.
            
        
    
    
        ABOUT American Goldfinch
        
            
                This handsome little finch, the state bird of New Jersey, Iowa, and Washington, is welcome and common at feeders, where it takes primarily sunflower and nyjer. Goldfinches often flock with Pine Siskins and Common Redpolls. Spring males are brilliant yellow and shiny black with a bit of white. Females and all winter birds are more dull but identifiable by their conical bill; pointed, notched tail; wingbars; and lack of streaking. During molts they look bizarrely patchy.
                Goldfinches are among the strictest vegetarians in the bird world, selecting an entirely vegetable diet and only inadvertently swallowing an occasional insect.
                Goldfinches are among the strictest vegetarians in the bird world, selecting an entirely vegetable diet and only inadvertently swallowing an occasional insect.
                Paired-up goldfinches make virtually identical flight calls; goldfinches may be able to distinguish members of various pairs by these calls.
                American Goldfinches breed later than most North American birds. They wait to nest until June or July when milkweed, thistle, and other plants have produced their fibrous seeds, which goldfinches incorporate into their nests and also feed their young.
